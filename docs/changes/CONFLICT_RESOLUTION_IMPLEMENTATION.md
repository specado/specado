# Conflict Resolution Implementation - Issue #20

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive conflict resolution system for mutually exclusive fields in the translation engine. This system integrates with the existing strictness policy (#19) and lossiness tracking (#18) to provide intelligent resolution of field conflicts according to provider constraints.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Conflict Resolution Module (`conflict.rs`)

#### Core Types
- **`FieldConflict`**: Represents a detected conflict between mutually exclusive fields
- **`ResolutionStrategy`**: Enum defining various resolution strategies:
  - `PreferenceOrder`: Use provider's resolution preferences
  - `FirstWins`: Keep the first field in document order
  - `LastWins`: Keep the last field in document order
  - `MostSpecific`: Keep the field with the most specific value
  - `Fail`: Fail on any conflict
  - `Custom`: Extensible custom resolution logic

- **`ConflictResolver`**: Main resolution engine that:
  - Detects conflicts based on provider constraints
  - Resolves conflicts using configured strategy
  - Tracks dropped fields in lossiness tracker
  - Respects strict mode policies

#### Key Features
- **Multi-Strategy Support**: Different resolution strategies for different use cases
- **Nested Field Support**: Handles conflicts in nested JSON structures
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Full audit trail of conflict resolutions
- **Provider Integration**: Uses provider-specific resolution preferences
- **Thread-Safe**: Works with shared `Arc<Mutex<LossinessTracker>>`

### 2. Integration with Translation Pipeline

#### translate() Function Enhancement
- Added Step 14: Conflict resolution after field mapping but before finalization
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution during translation
- Logging of resolved conflicts for transparency
- Full integration with lossiness tracking

#### Example Integration
```rust
// Step 14: Resolve conflicts using the conflict resolution system (issue #20)
let conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver::new(context.clone());
let conflicts = conflict_resolver.resolve_conflicts(&mut provider_request, Some(&lossiness_tracker))?;

// Log resolved conflicts if any
if !conflicts.is_empty() {
    eprintln!("Resolved {} field conflicts during translation", conflicts.len());
    for conflict in &conflicts {
        if let Some(winner) = &conflict.winner {
            eprintln!("  - Kept '{}', dropped {:?}", winner, conflict.losers);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Provider Constraint Support

#### Mutually Exclusive Fields
- Defined in provider spec as `Vec<Vec<String>>`
- Each inner vector represents a group of mutually exclusive fields
- Example: `[["temperature", "top_k"], ["stream", "stream_options"]]`

#### Resolution Preferences
- Ordered list of field preferences
- Used by `PreferenceOrder` strategy
- Example: `["temperature", "stream_options"]` prefers temperature over top_k

### 4. Strictness Policy Integration

#### Policy Evaluation
- **Strict Mode**: May fail on multiple conflicts
- **Warn Mode**: Warns but proceeds with resolution
- **Coerce Mode**: Silently resolves conflicts

#### Lossiness Tracking
- All dropped fields are tracked as transformations
- Includes metadata about conflict groups and resolution strategy
- Full audit trail with before/after values

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (8 tests in conflict module)
1. **test_detect_conflicts**: Verifies conflict detection logic
2. **test_resolve_by_preference**: Tests preference-based resolution
3. **test_resolve_first_wins_strategy**: Tests first-wins strategy
4. **test_resolve_most_specific_strategy**: Tests specificity-based resolution
5. **test_strict_mode_conflict_handling**: Tests strict mode behavior
6. **test_no_conflicts**: Verifies no-op when no conflicts exist
7. **test_nested_field_conflict**: Tests nested field handling
8. **test_comprehensive_tracking**: Verifies audit trail generation

### Integration Test
- **test_translate_with_conflict_resolution**: End-to-end test of conflict resolution in translate()

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conflict Resolution
```rust
let context = TranslationContext::new(prompt, provider, model, StrictMode::Warn);
let resolver = ConflictResolver::new(context);

let mut request = serde_json::json!({
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_k": 40,  // Conflicts with temperature
});

let conflicts = resolver.resolve_conflicts(&mut request, Some(&tracker))?;
// Result: temperature kept, top_k dropped (based on preferences)
```

### Custom Strategy Configuration
```rust
let config = ConflictResolutionConfig {
    strategy: ResolutionStrategy::MostSpecific,
    track_lossiness: true,
    warn_on_resolution: true,
    max_auto_resolutions: Some(10),
};
let resolver = ConflictResolver::with_config(context, config);
```

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Conflict detection only runs when mutually exclusive fields are defined
- **Efficient Detection**: O(n*m) where n is request fields and m is conflict groups
- **Thread-Safe**: Uses Arc<Mutex> for shared tracker with minimal contention
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only processes conflicts when they exist

## Backwards Compatibility

- **Fully Compatible**: Existing code works without changes
- **Opt-in Feature**: Conflicts only resolved when constraints defined
- **Default Behavior**: Uses preference order strategy by default
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs unchanged

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `crates/specado-core/src/translation/conflict.rs` (855 lines)
   - Complete conflict resolution implementation
   - Comprehensive test suite

2. **Modified**: `crates/specado-core/src/translation/mod.rs`
   - Added conflict module and exports
   - Integrated conflict resolution in translate() function
   - Added integration test

## Next Steps

With Issue #20 complete, the translation engine core is nearly finished:
- ✅ Issue #9: translate() function interface
- ✅ Issue #10: JSONPath mapping engine
- ✅ Issue #16: Pre-validation logic
- ✅ Issue #17: Field transformation system
