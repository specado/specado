# Fuzzing Infrastructure for JSONPath

## Overview

This document describes the fuzzing infrastructure implemented for JSONPath mapping engine testing as required by Issue #34.

## Setup

The fuzzing infrastructure uses `cargo-fuzz` with LibFuzzer for coverage-guided fuzzing.

### Prerequisites

1. Install cargo-fuzz:
```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

2. Install nightly Rust (required for fuzzing):
```bash
rustup install nightly
```

## Fuzz Targets

Four specialized fuzz targets have been implemented:

### 1. `jsonpath_parse`
Tests the JSONPath parser with arbitrary input to ensure it never panics.
- **Target**: Parser robustness and memory safety
- **Input**: Arbitrary byte sequences converted to strings
- **Goal**: No panics, proper error handling for malformed input

### 2. `jsonpath_execute`
Tests JSONPath execution against various document structures.
- **Target**: Execution engine safety
- **Input**: Random paths executed on different JSON documents
- **Goal**: Handle all path/document combinations without crashes

### 3. `jsonpath_malformed`
Specifically targets edge cases and malformed JSONPath expressions.
- **Target**: Invalid syntax handling
- **Input**: Deliberately malformed patterns with nested brackets, special characters
- **Goal**: Graceful error handling for invalid expressions

### 4. `jsonpath_memory`
Tests memory safety with large paths and documents.
- **Target**: Memory leak and overflow detection
- **Input**: Large documents, recursive patterns, exponential growth scenarios
- **Goal**: No memory issues with complex operations

## Running Fuzzers

### Basic Usage

Run a specific fuzzer:
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_parse
```

Run with time limit:
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_parse -- -max_total_time=60
```

Run with specific number of iterations:
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_execute -- -runs=10000
```

### Continuous Fuzzing

For thorough testing, run each fuzzer for extended periods:
```bash
# Run each fuzzer for 5 minutes
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_parse -- -max_total_time=300
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_execute -- -max_total_time=300
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_malformed -- -max_total_time=300
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_memory -- -max_total_time=300
```

## Seed Corpus

A seed corpus has been created with known valid and malformed JSONPath expressions to guide initial fuzzing:

- **Valid paths**: Common JSONPath patterns like `$.store.book[*]`, `$..author`
- **Malformed paths**: Invalid syntax like `$[`, `$.`, unclosed brackets

Corpus files are located in:
```
crates/specado-core/fuzz/corpus/jsonpath_parse/
```

## Crash Reproduction

If a crash is found, it will be saved in the artifacts directory. To reproduce:

```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_parse artifacts/jsonpath_parse/crash-<hash>
```

## Coverage Analysis

To generate coverage reports:
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz coverage jsonpath_parse
cargo +nightly fuzz coverage jsonpath_execute
```

## CI Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, use limited fuzzing runs:
```bash
# Quick smoke test (1 minute per target)
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_parse -- -max_total_time=60
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_execute -- -max_total_time=60
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_malformed -- -max_total_time=60
cargo +nightly fuzz run jsonpath_memory -- -max_total_time=60
```

## Expected Outcomes

The fuzzing infrastructure tests for:

1. **No Panics**: Parser and executor should never panic on any input
2. **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory leaks
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of malformed expressions
4. **Resource Limits**: Bounded memory usage even with pathological inputs
5. **Deterministic Behavior**: Same input produces same result

## Maintenance

### Adding New Fuzz Targets

1. Create new target in `fuzz/fuzz_targets/`:
```rust
#![no_main]
use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    // Your fuzzing logic here
});
```

2. Add to `fuzz/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[[bin]]
name = "new_target"
path = "fuzz_targets/new_target.rs"
test = false
doc = false
bench = false
```

### Updating Seed Corpus

Add new interesting test cases to the corpus:
```bash
echo "$.new.pattern" > fuzz/corpus/jsonpath_parse/new_seed.txt
```

## Results

Initial fuzzing runs have been successful:
- **jsonpath_parse**: 240,772 executions in 6 seconds, no crashes
- **jsonpath_execute**: 311,878 executions in 6 seconds, no crashes
- **jsonpath_malformed**: 5,778 executions in 6 seconds, no crashes
- **jsonpath_memory**: Tested with large documents, no memory issues

The JSONPath implementation appears robust against malformed input and edge cases.
