  - Effort (XS, S, M, L, XL)
  - Risk (Low, Medium, High)
- **All Issues Added**: Epics and tasks added to project board

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Create remaining child issues for Epics 3-5 using the pattern established
2. Set up project board columns (Backlog, Sprint Planning, In Progress, In Review, Done)
3. Configure field values for each issue (Sprint, Effort, Risk)

### Issue Creation Pattern
Use the established template in `github-issue-plan.md` to create remaining issues:
- Each epic should have 5-10 child tasks
- Follow the comprehensive issue template with acceptance criteria
- Maintain parent-child relationships
- Apply appropriate labels

### Commands for Continuing Work

#### Create More Issues
```bash
# Check for duplicates first
gh issue list --repo specado/specado --search "topic" --state all

# Create new issue
gh issue create --repo specado/specado --title 'Title' --body 'Body' --label 'task,priority:high'
```

#### Establish Parent-Child Relationships
```bash
# Get node IDs
gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "specado", name: "specado") {
    parent: issue(number: EPIC_NUMBER) { id }
    child: issue(number: TASK_NUMBER) { id }
  }
}'

# Create relationship
gh api graphql -H 'GraphQL-Features: sub_issues' -f query='
mutation {
  addSubIssue(input: {
    issueId: "PARENT_ID"
    subIssueId: "CHILD_ID"
  }) {
    issue { number }
  }
}'
```

#### Update Project Board
```bash
# Add issue to project
gh project item-add 9 --owner specado --url 'https://github.com/specado/specado/issues/NUMBER'

# View project
gh project view 9 --owner specado
```
