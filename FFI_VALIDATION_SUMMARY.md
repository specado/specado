# FFI Translation Validation Summary

## Initial Issue Identified

You were correct that the FFI was returning a simplified format `{ success, request, validation, error }` instead of the proper `TranslationResult`.

## Root Cause

The FFI library was not rebuilt after changes were made to the `translate.rs` file. The old compiled library was still returning the simplified format.

## Solution Applied

1. **Force Rebuild**: Used `touch crates/specado-ffi/src/translate.rs` to mark the file as changed
2. **Rebuild FFI**: `cargo build --release -p specado-ffi` to compile the updated code
3. **Verification**: Python test confirmed FFI now returns proper structure:
   - `provider_request_json`: The translated request
   - `lossiness`: Object with items array and max_severity  
   - `metadata`: Optional metadata about translation

## Current Status

✅ **FFI Fixed**: Now returns complete `TranslationResult` as expected
✅ **Core Translation**: Correctly calls `core_translate` from specado-core
✅ **Structure Verified**: Python test confirms proper output format

## Node.js Binding Status

The Node.js binding code is correct:
- `translate.rs` properly parses the `TranslationResult` from FFI
- `types.rs` has the correct `TranslateResult` structure with lossiness
- Example updated to display lossiness report

Some compilation issues remain due to FFI type imports that need minor fixes.

## Python Binding Status

The Python binding is correct:
- Already parses `TranslationResult` properly
- Example created to demonstrate lossiness report

## Key Learning

When making changes to FFI code, always ensure the library is rebuilt before testing. The old compiled library can persist and cause confusion about whether fixes have been applied.
